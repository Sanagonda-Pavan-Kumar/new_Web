            The Syncor approach to project management is based on Extreme
            Programming methodology. Our approach minimizes risks associated
            with software development projects such as missed deadlines, budget
            overruns and ‘buggy’ software, while also allowing for a rapid
            response to the changing and evolving needs of the project during
            implementation.
